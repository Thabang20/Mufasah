            <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p style="font-size:20px;">Mzamomtsha Primary School is located between Khayelistha Township and Umfuleni Township in the Western Cape Province of the Republic of South Africa.<br> The schools headmaster, Mr. Simphiwe Khuze, joined in 2007. The school is located in a semi-township called Drift Sands which started off as an informal settlement.<br> 
            Drift Sands has since been developed and with support from the South African government it turned into a sprawling township with state of the art housing units.<br><br> Mzamomtsha Primary School plays a key role in Drift Sands and is supporting the local community.
            <img src='remake3.jpg' align="right" width="500px" height="400px">
            The school was initially created for primary school students from grade 1 to grade 7, but due to the rapid population growth (births and migration) the school is also enrolling higher grades. Students are allowed up to grade 12 - which is the metric year.
         The rapid growth has lead to a series of problems for the Mzamomtsha Primary School. There are not enough classrooms to begin with and Mzamomtsha Primary School has no online presence. Besides, they can not find sufficient staff members to match the continuous growth. The school has 700 learners and a staff of 20 teachers.</p><br><br>

         <p style="font-size:20px;">The Mzamomtsha project from SAOTA is a fresh take on the relationship built between a community and their school building. Located in Driftsands, it branches out and improves on the design brief and style of schools which was previously dictated by the Department of Education and Training in Pretoria.
         It was a part of a school building programme that focused on a marginalized area affected by apartheid, rapid urbanization and urban migration. As Greg Truen, Project Partner explains, the growing population can be empowered within such a model, and transform itself into part school, part town hall, part civic centre and part sports centre that provide social and economic opportunity.
         The project was split into three distinct elements: those that belong to the children, those that relate to the administration of the school and those that the community can partly stake claim to. This third group comprises; the Computer Room, the Library, the Forum and a physical training slab (fitted as a basketball court), and was positioned closest to the entrance to the site. 
         Through the Internet and the library these facilities provide a link to the outside world representing a powerful resource for adult education, and creates a venue for community meetings, sports events etc. </p>
